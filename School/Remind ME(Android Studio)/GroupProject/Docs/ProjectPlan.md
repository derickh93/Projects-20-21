## Introduction:

Our application "Remind You" is being developed with the user in mind. An intuitive design and careful planning is being used 
to create our final product that will allow the user to manage their reminders and specific tasks. 

## Process Description:
#### Inception
* Identifying our target audience will give us a better idea of what users expect from the application and give us an
idea on the type of resources we will need.
* We will be using Android studio and choose to code in Java as most team members are comfortable with it.


#### Elaboration
* Android devices have many versions with varying specifications and hardware components so we must take that into consideration
when utilizing hardware components.
* We will take input from each team member and agree upon a design that is usable and meets the target audiences needs.
* Our team has agreed on limiting the number of activities needed to reach our final goal.


#### Construction
* One of the most important considerations is the UI design. The application will be based around the UI design.
* Each team member will contribute to either front end, back end, full stack, or database components of the program.
* We will use our test case to determine whether the application runs as expected without errors and bugs.

#### Transition
* The first release of the system will be considered a beta release that will be used to further test and improve the application.
Most of our functionality exist in the current release of the application. We will still need to properly implement the database so that
user reminders are saved. This is our goal for our final release.
* The documentation will be updated as changes are made to reflect the most current features available.
* The upkeep of documentation will allow us to maintain a detailed user manual.
* Eventually we will achieve all of our objectives considered with this application and the development cycle will be completed.
