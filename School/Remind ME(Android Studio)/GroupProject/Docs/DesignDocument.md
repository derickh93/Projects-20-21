## 1 Design Considerations

* It is important to consider who our target audience consist of. This will give us a better idea of what users expect 
 from the application.
* The performance of the application should also be considered in the initial design. The goal is to have a fast, crash free
 and easy to use application. 
* Finally, one of the most important considerations, the UI design. A simple and usable interface that leads to a hassle-free experience. 
This can be accomplished by thoroughly testing the application.

### 1.1 Assumptions

* Android offers documentation for all aspects of android studio that are well-structured, graphical and and easy to follow. This should allow
the team members to become familiar and well versed in new technology.
* Android development is accomplished with either Java/Kotlin. In this case we will be using Java as most team members 
are most familiar with it.
* Fast emulator is a new and improved emulator system included with android studio. This will allow team members that dont have 
    android device can still test and debug code.
* Android studio includes the visual layout editor to create layouts and views. It also allows you to preview your layout on
     varying device configurations.
* Intelligent code editor is also included with android studio. It allows you to write better code and be more productive.

### 1.2 Constraints

* Although there is much documentation on android studios website some of it require a great deal of time and effort to use and understand.
* Android devices can have stability and reliability issues due to the many version of Android devices, each with with varying specifications 
and hardware components.
* There can be issues with some team members working on Windows and some working on Mac. This needs to be addressed before 
we move on to the coding stage so that there wont be compatibility issues when multiple team members are working on code.
* Some of the difficulties that arose came to remotely working on the project design and coding. We came to the conclusion that our 
design and development would be most efficient when all team members are present so that we can share ideas and 
collaborate more efficiently, thus we will meet in person to complete the remainder of the development cycle.


### 1.3 System Environment

* Hardware
    * The system will need to interact with the various sensors located in android devices.
    * TYPE_ROTATION_VECTOR and TYPE_ORIENTATION which both have Software or Hardware implementation.
    * Storage which include both internal/external.

* Software 
    * Android Studio, Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA are among the many IDE's available for android development. We will be using Android studio.
    * Fast emulator is a new and improved emulator system included with android studio. This will allow team members that dont have 
    android device can still test and debug code.
