### We wanted to create a design where a user is able to control reminders. Derick’s and Shehan’s were the main influences of our design with their list of methods and ideas they brought. We did discuss using a hashmap to list all the reminders as the user is creating them. 















# Summary:
### -	We learned that everyone has a different thought process that can lead to varying solutions to be considered and the importance of being respectful when criticizing everyone ideas and input.
### -	We also learned that assigning everyone with clear responsiblities will work in our long term favour so the team is more productive.
### -	Everyone has different availability so time managment is very important.
### -   Shehan explained a few things regarding databases that reflects in our decision to go with a hashmap to store our reminders.
